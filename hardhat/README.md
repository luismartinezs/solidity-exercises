# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# Quickstart

## Local dev

- Run `pnpm node` to simulate a network with a number of addresses
- In another shell, run `pnpm deploy:local`
- `pnpm test` to run tests
